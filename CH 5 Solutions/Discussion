1.Given the initial statements:
  s1 = "spam"
  s2 = "ni!"
  Show the result of evaluating each of the following string expressions. 
  a) "The Knights who say, " + s2
    The Knights who say, ni!
  b) 3 * s1 + 2 * s2
    spamspamspamni!ni!
  c) s1[1]
    p
  d) s1[1:3]
    pa
      while [1:3] only includes 1 and 2
      spam 
      0123
  e) s1[2] + s2[:2]
    ani
  f) s1 + s2[-1]
    spam!
  g) s1.upper()
    SPAM
  h) s2.upper().ljust(4) * 3 
    NI! NI! NI!
      the width provides a space between them

2.Given the same initial statements as in the previous problem, show a
  Python expression that could construct each of the following results by
  performing string operations on s1 and s2.
  a) "NI"
    s2[:2].upper()
  b) "ni!spamni!"
    s2 + s1 + s2
  c) "Spam Ni! Spam Ni! Spam Ni!"
      (s1.title().ljust(4) + " " + s2.title().ljust(4))* 3
  d) "spam"
    s1
  e) ["sp" , "m"]
    s1.split("a")
  f) "spm" 
    s1[:2] + s1[3]
    
3.Show the output that would be generated by each of the following program fragments:
  a) for ch in "aardvark" :
        print (ch)
        
        a
        a
        r
        d
        v
        a
        r
        k
        
  b) for w in "Now is the winter of our discontent ... ". split () :
        print (w)
        
        now
        is
        the 
        winter
        of
        our
        discontent
        ...
        
  c) for w in "Mississippi ". split (" i") :
        print (w, end=" ")
        
        M ss ss pp
        
  d) msg = ""
     for s in "secret".split("e"):
        msg = msg + s
     print (msg)
        
        scrt
        
  e) msg = ""
     for ch in "secret":
        msg = msg + chr(ord(ch)+1)
     print (msg)
