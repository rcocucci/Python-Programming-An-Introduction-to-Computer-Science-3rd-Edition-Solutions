1.Given the initial statements:
  s1 = "spam"
  s2 = "ni!"
  Show the result of evaluating each of the following string expressions. 
  a) "The Knights who say, " + s2
    The Knights who say, ni!
  b) 3 * s1 + 2 * s2
    spamspamspamni!ni!
  c) s1[1]
    p
  d) s1[1:3]
    pa
      while [1:3] only includes 1 and 2
      spam 
      0123
  e) s1[2] + s2[:2]
    ani
  f) s1 + s2[-1]
    spam!
  g) s1.upper()
    SPAM
  h) s2.upper().ljust(4) * 3 
    NI! NI! NI!
      the width provides a space between them
2.Given the same initial statements as in the previous problem, show a
  Python expression that could construct each of the following results by
  performing string operations on s1 and s2.
  a) "NI"
  b) "ni ! spamni !"
  c) "Spam Ni ! Spam N. 1 I . Spam Ni !"
  d) "spam"
  e) ["sp" , "m"]
  f) "spm"
