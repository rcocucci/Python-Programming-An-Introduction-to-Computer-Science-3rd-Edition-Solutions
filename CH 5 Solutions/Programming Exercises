# 1. As discussed in the chapter, string formatting could be used to simplify the dateconvert2 . py program. 
#    Go back and redo this program making use of the string-formatting method.

#  3. A certain CS professor gives 100-point exams that are graded on the scale 
#     90-100:A, 80-89:B, 70-79:C, 60-69:D, <60:F. Write a program that accepts an exam score as 
#     input and prints out the corresponding grade. 

def main():
    score1 = int(input("Enter the exam score: "))
    score = "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDCCCCCCCCCCBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAA"

#  4. An acronym is a word formed by taking the first letters of the words in a
#     phrase and making a word from them. For example, RAM is an acronym
#     for "random access memory." Write a program that allows the user to
#     type in a phrase and then outputs the acronym for that phrase. Note: The
#     acronym should be all uppercase, even if the words in the phrase are notcapitalized.
